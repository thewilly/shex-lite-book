\section{Open Source Community}
Regarding the open source community, from the beginning the work was considered as a
collaborative project where the community could debate, validate and contribute new
ideas to the project.

The \url{http://github.com/weso/shex-lite} repository has primarily been used as the central source of code. But
there is a parallel repository \url{http://github.com/weso/shex-lite-evolution} where there are records of some proposals that affect
the design of the system.

GitHubFlow\footnote{\url{https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/}}, a variant of
GitFlow\footnote{\url{https://www.atlassian.com/es/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow}} oriented to unlock the advance that occurs on many
occasions, has been used as a methodology to work. In this way a user can send an issue,
make the appropriate code modification and create a pull request that once accepted becomes
directly part of the most recent version of the system. An example of this is the
pull request SLP-0143 \url{https://github.com/weso/shex-lite/pull/143} where a community user implemented python code generation on
their own.
