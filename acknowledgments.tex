    This work has been partially funded by the European
    Hercules project through the WESO research group at
    the University of Oviedo.

    In addition, for the development of the research we
    have worked with different research groups and researchers
    such as Dublin Core or Eric Prud'hommeaux to whom I would
    like to thank the warm welcome.

    Finally, I would like to thank my tutors Jose Emilio
    Labra Gayo and Daniel Fernández Álvarez for all the
    work carried out within the framework of this project.
