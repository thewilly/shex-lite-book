\section{Future Work}
Currently both proposed solutions are based on the reduced ShEx grammar,
therefore the first future work we identify is to be able to bring the philosophies
described in this work to the full ShEx grammar, so that the improvements described
can benefit all users of the language.

The next step would be to expand the range of the static analysis of shape expressions
so that it supports more elements of the grammar so that all the elements that make
up a shape, their dependencies and relationships can be analyzed in much more detail.
