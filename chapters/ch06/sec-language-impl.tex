\section{ShEx-Lite Language Implementation}
The implementation of the language was carried out by means of the tool Antlr \sidecite{parr1995antlr},
this tool allows to define a grammar by means of the lexer and the rules that compose the syntax and
automatically generate the parser.

First step then is to define our lexer grammar, this grammar can be found at \refch{shex-lite-lex-spec}
