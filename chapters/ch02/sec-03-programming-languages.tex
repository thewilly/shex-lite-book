\section{Programming Languages}
According to \sidecite{programing-language} “a programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output.” When we talk about programming languages we need to know that they are split into two, General Purpose Languages (GPL) and Domain Specific Languages (DSL). The main difference overtime is that, as said in \sidecite{dsl}, a domain-specific language (DSL) is a computer language specialized to a particular application domain in contrast to a general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains.
In the specific case of ShEx-Lite we will be talking about a Domain Specific Language, and more deep we would classified it as a Declarative one, that means that it is not Touring Complete \sidecite{touring-complete}.
