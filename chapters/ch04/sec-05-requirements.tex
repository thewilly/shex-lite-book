\section{Requirements}
\labsec{ch04-requirements}

In this section we are going to enumerate the requirements that we have obtained for the
compiler. Since the line that separates functional and non-functional requirements can be
sometimes hard to define, we decided to specify the requirements following the taxonomy
introduced in the IEEE 830 standard for the specification of software requirements. The
following types of requirements will be evaluated:

\begin{itemize}
    \item External interfaces: Requirements that affect user, hardware, software or communication interfaces.
    \item Functional requirements: Requirements related to the functions of the system.
    \item Performance requirements: These requirements are related to the load that the system should tolerate.
    \item Logical database requirements: These requirements are related to access or constraints with the system’s database.
    \item Design constraints: Constraints imposed by standards, hardware limitations…
    \item Other constraints.
    \item System attributes: Quality attributes of the system, such as usability, accessibility…
    \item Other requirements that do not belong to any of the categories above.
\end{itemize}
