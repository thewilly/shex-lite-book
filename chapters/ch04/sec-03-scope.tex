The ShEx-Lite compiler is mean to be a compiler for a syntax based on a subset of the
Shape Expressions Compact Syntax. The compiler is aimed at people with a few technical
skills that need to write schemas to validate RDF but donâ€™t want to learn the full ShEx
Language, but also to more experienced developers that would like to automatically
generate domain object models and test new functionalities without the drawback of
implementing them on a production system.
