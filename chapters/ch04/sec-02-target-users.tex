\section{Target Users}
\labsec{ch04-target-users}

Every system has some target users, in the case of the SeX-Lite compiler we will focus it on three different types of users:
\begin{itemize}
    \item People with low technical skills that want to make schemas to validate RDF by means
    of shape expressions. This people will be able to compile their schemes and check for
    syntax / semantic errors or warnings through the CLI with a very simple instruction set.
    \item People with medium technical skills that want to transform a set of shape expressions
    in to a domain object model automatically. For this people the compiler will provide a
    manual that will explain each step of the transformation and an usage example.
    \item ShEx Community developers that want to test a new feature by implementing and
    testing its behaviors in a controlled small environment. For this people the compiler
    provides not only the public API but the source code and the corresponding technical
    documentation. 
\end{itemize}
