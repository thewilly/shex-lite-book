\chapter{Compiler Analysis}
\labch{compiler-analysis}

In this chapter we present the analysis that was carried out in order to design the compiler. First we sumarize the objectives and the target users of the compiler, this will be the starting point of the analysis. After, we will define an scope from which we will stract the use cases and requirements that, finally, will help to identify possible subsystems for the design phase, explained in \refch{compiler-design}.
