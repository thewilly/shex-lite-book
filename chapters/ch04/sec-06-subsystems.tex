\section{Identified Subsystems}
\labsec{ch04-subsystems}

Once the definition of the scope was finished, and the requirements were captured and documented, the following subsystems were identified.

\subsection{Compiler}
The compiler subsystem, called shexlc includes all the necessary elements to validate that
an schema is correct, or provide with the necessary information to fix any error it might
contain. And generate domain object models for the correct schemas. 

\subsection{CLO tool}
The CLI Tool provide both non technical and mid technical users the ability to use the
compiler from a text interface, allowing them to validate syntactically and semantically the
schemas. This validation involves also informing if any error or warning is generated during
the compilation. And in the case mid technical users also it provides the ability to generate
domain object models by saving them in the computer as source files. 

\subsection{Public API}
The compiler public API, called shexl, provides to the ShEx Community developers the
ability to access the different stages of the compilation process independently. Its main
objective is to provide them with a simple API that allows them not only to integrate the
compiler on different applications but also to extend it easily.
