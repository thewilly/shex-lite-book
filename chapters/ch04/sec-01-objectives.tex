The main aim of this project is sumarize on its title, the implementation if a system that can
automatically transform shape expressions, expressed in a ShEx subset syntax, in to multiple
object-oriented-languages domain models.

Therefore, in order to meet that main goal we will need to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{define a syntax based on a subset of ShEx},
    \item \textbf{design and implement a compiler for that syntax}
\end{itemize}
and add a feature to
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{allow the translation from shapes to object-oriented-languages domain models}.
\end{itemize}

Now that we add more detail to our main aim by splitting it into three goals we can perform the individual
analysis for each one.
